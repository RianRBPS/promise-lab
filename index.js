/*
    A Promise is in one of these states:

    pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
    rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

    A promise is said to be settled if it is either fulfilled or rejected, but not pending.
